# Bundled SoundFonts

This folder is packaged and installed with the app by both `PKGBUILD` files.
By default, build/install flows fetch two CC0 SoundFonts from FreePats:
- `UprightPianoKW-small-20190703.sf2` (default piano)
- `EGuitarFSBS-bridge-clean-small-20220911.sf2` (default clean electric guitar)

Before adding any `.sf2` here, verify redistribution rights and keep license
or attribution details with the project.

Recommended policy:
- Only include SoundFonts with explicit redistribution permission.
- Add the source URL and license name for each bundled file.
- Remove any SoundFont immediately if licensing is unclear.
